ON AIR since 2016, Seoul Community Radio is an award-winning broadcast platform dedicated to Korean underground music and culture.
 
Streaming daily via our Itaewon studio and at key locations both home and abroad, we work with leading artists, brands and institutions to help showcase Korean subculture in dynamic new ways.

Our influential audience, born from Koreans with eclectic tastes continues to expand, and we are on the lookout for relevant partners to help our mission to support Seoulâ€™s growth as a leading credible music destination.
