Off the back of an incredible 2018 – including curating the prestigious DJ Kicks mix series and a 27-country world tour – DJ Seinfeld will kick off the new year in Tokyo in fine style through a collaboration with Tokyo-based rave platform/label N.O.S. and Seoul’s popular underground radio show and promoter, Seoul Community Radio.

Nitrous Oxide Systems (N.O.S.) and Seoul Community Radio (S.C.R) present DJ Seinfeld will be held on Friday the 18th 2018 at one of Tokyo’s most loved underground venues, Circus. DJ Seinfeld, one of the pioneers of the lo-fi house sound and a leading light in the current rave revival returns to Tokyo after a stunning performance 1 year ago, having honed his skills and developed his sound across a 27-country worldwide tour. With his productions having taken a darker, harder turn, DJ Seinfeld’s mix of breakbeat, electro and ravier cuts is the perfect match for Tokyo’s N.O.S. crew, who since their inception in March of 2018 and have been pushing the boundaries and speed limits of the Tokyo underground dance music scene.

N.O.S. have invited the Seoul Community Radio team to co-host proceedings, pioneers in online radio based out of Seoul who have been essential in developing their local scenes but have also started to gain traction and a profile abroad. S.C.R. is a must stop for DJs touring Asia but also a platform for up and coming artists to reach new audiences. S.C.R. can also boast collaborations with a variety of major brands including Nike, Vans and Boiler Room, as well as contributing to several festivals.

S.C.R. will bring up-and-coming artist and DJ Yuzo to perform her Tokyo debut and will stream the entire event as a special one-off broadcast. Room 2 will serve as a special pop-up shop so you party-goers will be able to grab popular S.C.R. merchandise on the day.

This is two of Asia’s most exciting promoters and players presenting one of the underground dance music scene’s most exciting producers – do not sleep!
