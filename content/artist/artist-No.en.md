title: "No She Doesnt"	
artist-name: "No She Doesnt"	
artist-description: "No She Doesn't is a label/crew of DJ Spielberg & DJ Legwarmer. Two of them are making a fresh house music movement in Lisbon, Portugal. No She Doesn't is not just a label but also a movement: an open minded way of approaching life has led us to put values such as equality, freedom and fun as priorities. They try to express it in our tunes and parties and in the feelings they provide, because the idea of an unprejudiced society is what drives them in this path of beautiful music which we hope people enjoy."
