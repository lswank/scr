artist-description: "DJ Soulscape is a legend vinyl player/Producer in Korea head honcho of the 360 Sounds imprint. Deeply influenced by â€™80s hip-hop, his parent's extensive collection of soul vinyl, and his engineering background, the musician is a culmination of diversity and contrast. Korean underground music scene cannot be explained without him. He has performed with DJ Young Guru, Illa J, and LEFTO, to name a few. Soulscape composes and arranges electronic symphonies reminiscent of K-pop, yet innovative in style and genre. "
