artist-name: "INFLUENCE / Ligrye"	
artist-description: "Lindsay Ryklief aka LIGRYE has brought his blend of house, R&B and bass to Seoul underground staple venues since his 2013 debut at Exit. His soundscapes have shapeshifted since then and evolved to include afrobeats, ballroom house and experimental world rhythms.He has contributed his select sound to parties such as Pute Deluxe and Boiler Room in Seoul as well as bigger festivals such as ULTRA Korea, Holiday Land and Arcadia Festival in Jamsil. He is a natural collaborator and has added his flavor as a core member of the Pute Deluxe creative collective, and his residency at the TRES parties with the formidable Kingmck has put him on the map as a permanent fixture in the Seoul underground music scene."
